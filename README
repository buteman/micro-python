This is my little project to create a simple type of oscilloscope using my laptop
running Ubuntu Linux and my micropython board ( it hasn't arrived yet).
At present I am thinking to make it work as follows:

1/ Laptop writes a small file to the SD card on the board via USB
   This file will tell the board how long to sample one of the ADC's.

2/ The board will read this file, delete it and carry out the task.

3/ The board will read the values from the ADC and write them to another file.
   When it has completed the task it will write a small file which will simply be used
   so the laptop knows the task has been completed.

4/ The laptop will copy this file to it's own hard disc and then the data can be displayed
   by the program.

So far the code for the laptop has got to the point where it's reading from a dummy file 
containing random data created by a small python script. It allows the data to be displayed
much as it would appear on an oscilloscope, displaying all the data in the file. Both how many 
data points are displayed and how long a pause takes place before each update can be selected.
It is also possible to select the first point in the file to display and how many points to display
as a static display. 
A function has been started to create the instruction file but of course it cannot be fully implemented
until the board is available.
